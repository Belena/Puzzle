               <img class="pictures" src="images/sunflowers.jpg" data-answer="<b>Sunflowers 1888, Vincent van Gogh</b>.
               <br />
 The Sunflowers is one of the most popular paintings in the National Gallery. It is the painting that is most often reproduced on cards, posters, mugs, tea-towels and stationery. It was also the picture that Van Gogh was most proud of.<br />

It was painted during a rare period of excited optimism, while Van Gogh awaited the arrival of his hero, the avant-garde painter Paul Gauguin.

The lonely and passionate Vincent had moved to Arles, in the South of France, where he dreamed of setting up a community of artists with Gauguin as its mentor.<br /> Why sunflowers?

Sunflowers had a special significance for Van Gogh. He made 11 paintings of them.
<br />
Yellow, for him, was an emblem of happiness – in Dutch literature, the sunflower was a symbol of devotion and loyalty. In their various stages of decay, these flowers also remind us of the cycle of life and death. When Van Gogh moved to Paris in 1886, he was exposed to the bold palettes of the Impressionists, such as Renoir, with their use of bright and opposing colours.
<br />
The influence of the Impressionists transformed Van Gogh's own use of colour. He began to experiment with bright, unmixed colours. He was dismissive of the movement as a whole, however, accusing it of being purely decorative.
<br />
Van Gogh was more interested in some of the Post-Impressionists who, like himself, were more concerned with investing the objects in their paintings with significance and symbolism.">
               

              
                <img class="pictures" src="images/Monalisa.jpg" data-answer="<b>Mona Lisa 1503–1519, Leonardo Da Vinci </b><br />
The Mona Lisa is quite possibly the most well-known piece of painted artwork in the entire world. It was painted by the Leonardo Da Vinci, the famous Italian artist, between 1504 and 1519, and is a half body commission for a woman named Lisa Gherardini. Her husband, Francesco Del Giocondo requested the work by Da Vinci just after the turn of the century. It is perhaps the most studied piece of artwork ever known. The subject’s facial expression has brought about a source of debate for centuries, as her face remains largely enigmatic in the portrait. Originally commissioned in Italy, it is now at home in the French Republic, and hangs on display in the Louvre in Paris.
<br />
Background.<br />
The work was requested by subject’s husband, Francesco Del Giocondo. Lisa was from a well-known family known through Tuscany and Florence and married to Francesco Del Giocondo who was a very wealthy silk merchant. The work was to celebrate their home’s completion, as well as a celebration of the birth of their second son. Not until 2005 was the identity of Mona Lisa‘s subject fully understood, though years of speculation have suggested the true identity of the painting’s subject.
<br />
The Mona Lisa is famous for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons, of course, for the popularity of the painting is the artist himself. Leonardo da Vinci is perhaps the most recognized artist in the world. Not only was Da Vinci an artist, but he was also a scientist, inventor, and a doctor. His study of the human form came from the study of actual human cadavers.

Because of his ability to study from the actual form of the human, he was able to draw and paint it more accurately than any other artist of his time. While the Mona Lisa may be revered as the greatest piece of artwork of all time, Da Vinci was known more for his ability to draw than to paint. 

But most prominently Da Vinci has been known throughout the centuries as a scientist and inventor. ">

                <img class="pictures" src="images/venus.jpg" data-answer="<b>The Birth of Venus 1482-1486, Sandro Botticelli</b> <br />
Sandro Botticelli (1444-1510) was a master of Renaissance art and The Birth of Venus, one of his most famous works, now hangs in the Uffizi gallery in Florence. The painting shows Venus, the goddess of love, in an interpretation of classical myth. Botticelli painted this pagan theme at a time when most paintings depicted Christian ideals and the vast majority of women in paintings were depicted as a chaste Virgin Mary, so it is surprising that he chose to paint Venus as a nude. <br />
It was only to due to Botticelli's friendship with the powerful Medici family that the painting escaped the ire of the Catholic Church and Savonarola's bonfires, where several other pagan Botticelli paintings perished in the flames. The painting shows Venus emerging from the sea on a shell, a fully grown woman, being blown to shore by Zephyrs, who are symbols of spiritual passions, while roses shower down upon her. One of the goddesses of the seasons, or Horae, hands her a cloak as she prepares to step on the shore. Many different aspects of Botticelli's painting are in motion, from Venus's flowing ringlets that cascade around her to the billowing gown that is being presented to her. <br />

It is in keeping with Renaissance era inspiration that one of Botticelli's most famous paintings represents not a Christian legend, but a classical myth - the Birth of Venus. Whilst the works of the classical poets had been known through the middle Ages, it was only at the time of the Renaissance, when the Italians tried so passionately to recapture the former glory of Rome that classical myths become popular among educated laymen.

For the men of the Renaissance, the mythology of the Greeks and Romans represented a superior form of truth and wisdom. Whilst Botticelli carried out the artwork, it is highly likely that the commissioner (a member of the powerful Medici) provided the original source of inspiration and that either he, or one of his learned friends, explained to the artist what was the story, as recounted by the ancients regarding Venus rising from the sea. The story would have been seen as a symbol of mystery in which the divine message came into the world, and Botticelli has done his best to depict this myth in a worthy manner.">

                <img class="pictures" src="images/girl.jpg" data-answer="<b>Girl with a Pearl Earring 1665, Johannes Vermeer</b><br />
Girl with a Pearl Earring was originally titled Girl with a Turban and it wasn't until the second half of the twentieth century that the name was changed. Regarded as Vermeer's masterpiece, this canvas is often referred to as the Mona Lisa of the North or the Dutch Mona Lisa.
<br />
The girl in this painting is believed to be Vermeer's eldest daughter, Maria, who was about twelve or thirteen-years-old at the time it was created. Her facial features appear in several of Vermeer's works but his various techniques on his subject make it difficult to compare the female faces in his paintings, as the woman are portrayed in different lighting conditions and poses.
<br />
There is very little information about Vermeer and his paintings. Girl with a Pearl Earring is signed 'IVMeer' but there is no date on this work. It remains unknown whether or not this canvas was commissioned and if so, by whom. It's more likely that this image was a tronie, Dutch 17th-century description of a 'head' painting that was not intended as a portrait.
<br />
Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of over forty images of women created by Vermeer and thus it is obvious that he had a keen interest in women's socio-cultural roles. It could be argued that he valued their role in maintaining his idealist way of life by ensuring order within the household and raising children within Christian values. Therefore, women played a pivotal role in safeguarding tradition and moral values through the generations.
<br />
Vermeer depicted his women in thought-provoking stillness and also as encouraging images that inspired homogeny.
<br />
With this painting the viewer is captured by the subject and believes they have caught her attention and caused her to turn her head. This is a sensual painting with the girl gazing at the viewer with wide eyes and a parted mouth and there is an air of mystery surrounding her identity.
In 1994 this canvas was restored which involved removing the yellowed varnish along with the retouches that had been made during previous restorations. This resulted in the vivid colors originally used by Vermeer shining through and the intimacy of the girl's gaze was also greatly enhanced.">

                <img class="pictures" src="images/thekiss.jpg" data-answer="<b>The Kiss 1907-1908,  Gustav Klimt </b><br />
The Kiss (In German: Der Kuss) was painted by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt between 1907 and 1908, the highpoint of his 'Golden Period', when he painted a number of works in a similar gilded style. A perfect square, the canvas depicts a couple embracing, their bodies entwined in elaborate robes decorated in a style influenced by both linear constructs of the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. The work is composed of oil paint with applied layers of gold leaf, an aspect that gives it its strikingly modern, yet evocative appearance. The painting is now in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere palace, Vienna, and is widely considered a masterpiece of the early modern period. It is a symbol of Vienna Jugendstil—Viennese Art Nouveau—and is considered Klimt's most popular work.
<br />
The theme of a pair of lovers, united through a kiss, was one that occupied Klimt throughout his career. Variations on this theme can be found early on in his works. Klimt's Beethoven Frieze (1902), reflecting his increased emphasis on ornamentation and the use of gold leaf, represented an important artistic precursor to his most famous painting. The inspiration for his 'Golden Phase', which culminated with The Kiss, was presumably provided by a visit to Ravenna during his travels through Italy in 1903, which introduced him to the world of Byzantine mosaics. But Klimt was also influenced by contemporary painters: the abstract, decorative style of the Dutch Symbolist Jan Theodor must be mentioned here, as well as the Belgian Symbolist painter Fernand Khnopff.
<br />
In the painting a couple is depicted embracing in a field of flowers. The man is bent over the woman, and she - clinging tightly to him - awaits his kiss. In terms of ornamentation, the male figure is characterized by square and rectangular forms, while in the case of the female soft lines and floral patterns are dominant. A golden halo surrounds the couple, but it ends at the bare feet of the female, whose toes are sharply bent and firmly dug into the flower-covered meadow. At the same time, however, the couple seems to have shaken off this last remnant of earthly weight and has been transported into another infinite, almost sacred sphere, reminiscent indeed of the gold background of Byzantine mosaics.
<br />
When Klimt presented the painting to the public for the first time, in 1908, it was acquired - still unfinished - directly from the exhibition by the Austrian Gallery. This painting represents the centrepiece of the world's largest collection of works by Gustav Klimt, located in the Austrian Gallery in Vienna's Upper Belvedere Palace.

                <img class="pictures" src="images/memory.jpg" data-answer="<b>The Persistence of Memory 1931, Salvador Dali </b>
<br />
The Persistence of Memory was painted by Salvador Dali in 1931 and is one of his most famous works. It is currently housed in the Museum of Modern Art, New York. It has a huge fan following to date and is frequently referred to in popular culture. The surrealist artist Salvador Dali (May 11, 1904 to January 23, 1989) was born in Figueres, Spain.
<br />
The Persistence of Memory and Surrealism
Surrealism was a cultural movement which had its origins in the 1920’s. Surrealist works of art feature an element of surprise, unforeseen comparisons, and irreverent humor. At times this art, which is a free flowing expression of the artist’s imagination, is difficult to interpret and The Persistence of Memory is no exception. It uses the concept of hard and soft objects.
<br />
Expert Interpretations
The Persistence of Memory depicts a scene showing pocket watches, detached from their chains, melting slowly on rocks and branches of a tree, with the ocean as a back drop. A part of the painting is basked in sunlight and a part is shrouded in a shadow. Looking carefully you can see too small rocks, one in the sunlight and the other in the shadow.
<br />
Dali frequently used the philosophy of hard and soft in his paintings. The melting watches points to time being flowing and eternal, whereas the hard rocks are the reality of life and the ocean represents the vastness of the earth. There is an orange clock covered with ants. He used the symbolism to convey the decay of time or death (and at times, the female genitalia). The strange human figure in the center could be interpreted, as a formless person we would imagine, while we are in a dreamlike trance.
<br />
Dali’s Interpretation
There have been so many interpretations and analysis of The Persistence of Memory, but Dali never himself interpreted or explained his work. The art critic Dawn Ades wrote that “the soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time”. When Dali was asked if this allusion to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was true, he replied, rather flippantly, that it was a surrealist vision of Camembert cheese melting in the heat of the sun.
<br />
Experts have said that The Persistence of Memory was a painting during his Freudian phase of life, before the Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki propelled him into his scientific phase. Whatever Dali wanted to convey by the painting, he took the interpretation with him to his grave. In a strange sort of way, each of us could interpret it in our own way and would all be right. Who knows, that may be what Dali intended.
<br />
The painting has attracted the attention of art lovers for decades. Criticism and praise have been heaped on The Persistence of Memory, in equal measure. For those who favor the Surrealist genre of art, it is a masterpiece. To others it is junk, or at the best, the painting of a madman. Be that as it may, it is one work of art which will never fade away and will always provoke arguments and interpretations.

                <img class="pictures" src="images/sunrise.jpg" data-answer="<b>Impression Sunrise 1983, Claude Monet</b>
                <br />
In the muted palette of the emerging dawn, Claude Monet portrayed the industrial port of Le Havre on the northern coast of France. The brilliant orange of the rising sun glimmers amid the damp air and dances on the gentle rippling water, lighting up its iridescent blues and greens. Barely discernible through a cool haze, pack boats on the left billow smoke from their stacks. Painted during the spring of 1873 as the country struggled to rebuild following the Franco-Prussian war, this Sunrise might also metaphorically suggest a new day dawning in France. 

Sunrise exemplifies Monet's plein air , or 'outdoor' approach to painting. The informal and spontaneous brushstrokes establish this picture as one of the first works, along with the famous Impression: Sunrise at the Marmottan Museum in Paris, in the Impressionist style that was to make him famous. The ephemeral play of light, water, and air would remain Monet's subject for the rest of his career. 
Throughout the years, Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise has been celebrated as the quintessential symbol of the Impressionist Movement.  This renowned work of art which illustrates a view of the port of Le Havre in north-western France is considered to be one of Monet’s “most poetic expressions” of his engagement with France’s revitalization efforts after the Franco-Prussian War.[1] Unlike other artworks of the time, the subject matter and specific painting techniques evident in Impression, Sunrise seek to transcribe the feelings initiated by a scene rather than simply rendering the details of a particular landscape.  This act of expressing an individual’s perception of nature was a key characteristic and goal of Impressionist art, and is a common motif found in Monet’s paintings.  While Impression, Sunrise and Monet’s artistic technique fell under harsh criticism at their outset, Monet’s masterpiece gave birth to a new movement and created a revolution in the world of art.
<br />
Widely regarded as Monet’s single most famous painting, Impression, Sunrise was completed during the late nineteenth century in 1872.  The most significant aspect of the painting is its credit with giving the Impressionist Movement its name.  When the painting was first shown to the public in the L’Exposition des Révoltés—an exhibition independent of the Salon that was organized by Monet, Bazille, Pissarro, and their friends—many critics were extremely disapproving of the rebel group’s work, especially that of Monet.[2] In the April issue of Le Charivari, a critic named Louis Leroy judgmentally entitled his article “Exhibition of the Impressionists,” thereby coining the term inspired by the title of Monet’s work Impression, Sunrise.  Although this oil painting was disparaged during the time of its creation, today it is viewed as an austere example of the mindset and purpose behind Impressionism.  Currently, Impression, Sunrise is located in the Musée Marmottan in Paris, France.<br />

                <img class="pictures" src="images/madonna.jpg" data-answer="<b>The Sistine Madonna 1512-1514 Raffaello Sanzio, called Raphael</b><br />
The first fact to know is that the proper art-historical title of the painting is The Madonna Standing on Clouds with SS. Sixtus and Barbara. This is one of those titles that begs for reduction however, so everyone calls it the Sistine Madonna.
<br />
The painting was commissioned in 1512 by Pope Julius II in honor of his late uncle, Pope Sixtus IV. Its destination was the Benedictine basilica San Sisto in Piacenza, a church with which the Rovere family had a long-standing relationship.
<br />
The Madonna
<br />
In this case there is quite a back-story regarding the model. She is assumed to be Margherita Luti (Italian, ca. 1495-?), the daughter of a Roman baker named Francesco. We believe that Margherita was Raphael's mistress for the last twelve years of his life, from some point in 1508 until his death in 1520.
<br />
Bear in mind that there isn't a paper trail of, say, a palimony agreement between Raphael and Margherita. Their relationship seems to have been an open secret, though, and there is evidence galore through the artist's paintings that the couple was extremely comfortable with one another. Margherita sat for at least 10 paintings, six of which were Madonnas. However, it is the last painting, La Fornarina (1520), on which the 
'mistress' claim hangs. In it, she is nude from the waist up (save for a hat), and sports a ribbon around her left upper arm inscribed with Raphael's name.
<br />
The Sistine Madonna hangs in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Old Masters Gallery) of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden ('Dresden State Art Collections') in Dresden, Germany. The painting has been there since 1752/54, except for the years 1945-55 when it was in the possession of the Soviet Union. Thankfully for Dresden, the Soviets repatriated it fairly quickly as a gesture of goodwill.

                <img class="pictures" src="images/trinity.jpg" data-answer="<b>The Trinity 1370-1430, Andrei Rublev </b>
The Church has many different depictions of the Holy Trinity. But the icon which defines the very essence of Trinity Day is invariably the one which shows the Trinity in the form of three angels. The prototype for this icon was the mysterious appearance of the Holy Trinity in the form of three travelers to Abraham and Sarah under the oak of Mamre. The Church specifically chose this particular icon because it most fully expresses the dogma of the Holy Trinity: the three angels are depicted in equal dignity, symbolizing the triunity and equality of all three Persons.We find the deepest understanding of this dogma in the icon of the Trinity painted by the venerable Andrei Rublev for the Trinity Cathedral of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra. This icon is a masterpiece of ancient Russian iconography, and it is not surprising that the Church established it as the model for depicting the Trinity.<br />
In Andrei Rublev’s icon, the persons of the Holy Trinity are shown in the order in which they are confessed in the Credo. The first angel is the first person of the Trinity - God the Father; the second, middle angel is God the Son; the third angel is God the Holy Spirit. All three angels are blessing the chalice, in which lies a sacrificed calf, prepared for eating. The sacrifice of the calf signifies the Saviour’s death on the cross, while its preparation as food symbolizes the sacrament of the Eucharist. All three angels have staffs in their hand as a symbol of their divine power.
<br />
The first angel, shown at left, is vested in a blue undergarment which depicts his divine celestial nature, and a light purple outer garment which attests to the unfathomable nature and the royal dignity of this angel. Behind him and above his head towers a house, the abode of Abraham, and a sacrificial altar in front of the house. This image of the abode has a symbolic meaning: the house signifies God’s master plan for creation, while the fact that the house towers above the first angel shows him to be the head (or Father) of this creation. The same fatherly authority is seen in his entire appearance. His head is not bowed and he is looking at the other two angels. His whole demeanor - the expression on his face, the placement of his hands, the way he is sitting - all speaks of his fatherly dignity. The other two angels have their heads inclined and eyes turned toward the first angel with great attention, as though conversing with him about the salvation of mankind.<br />
The second angel is placed in the middle of the icon. This placement is determined by the position held by the second Person within the Trinity Itself. Above his head extend the branches of an oak tree. The vestments of the second angel correspond to those in which the Saviour is usually depicted. The undergarment is a dark crimson color which symbolizes the incarnation, while the blue outer robe signifies the divinity and the celestial nature of this angel. The second angel is inclined towards the first angel, as though deep in conversation. The tree behind him serves as a reminder of the tree of life that was standing in Eden, and of the cross.<br />
The angel on the right is the third Person of the Trinity - the Holy Spirit. His light blue undergarment and smoky-green outer garment represent heaven and earth, and signify the life-giving force of the Holy Spirit, which animates everything that exists. “By the Holy Spirit every soul lives and is elevated in purity” - sings the Church. This elevation in purity is represented in the icon by a mountain above the third angel.
Thus Andrei Rublev’s icon, while being an unsurpassed work of iconography, is first and foremost a “theology in color,” which instructs us in all that concerns the revelation of the triune God and the three Persons of the Holy Trinity.
